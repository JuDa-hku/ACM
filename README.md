Program learning material.

-[cs106B](http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1136/) is a wonderful course for new comers in program world. People can build system by using Stanford c++ Lib,  try shortest-length algorithm and learn how to implement basic data structure. Once, I thought programming in c++ is a tough and low pay thing but through the course, I found c or c++ is so fundamental and people need to know these bits and byte thing.

-[Mining Massive Datasets](https://class.coursera.org/mmds-001) There is a book written for this course and basically, the course cover kinds of methods to analysis massive datasets and explain the structure of map-reduce. [Here] is the brief introduction for this course.
