Program learning material.

-Cs106B is a wonderful course for new comers in program world. People can build system by using Stanford c++ Lib,  try shortest-length algorithm and learn how to implement basic data structure. Once, I thought programming in c++ is a tough and low pay thing but through the course, I found c or c++ is so fundamental and people need to know these bits and byte thing.
